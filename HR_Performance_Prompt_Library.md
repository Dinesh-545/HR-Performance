- AI Tool: Cursor

---


## 0. üöÄ Initial Architecture & Roadmap Prompt

Paste this first into **Cursor‚Äôs AI Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí Cursor: New AI Chat`) to establish the overall architecture and development plan.

```
I need to design an enterprise HR performance management system using Angular frontend, .NET Web API backend, and SQL Server.

## Business Context:
The HR department wants to digitize employee performance reviews, goal tracking, and skill assessments.

## Core Functional Requirements:
1. Employee Profiles with org hierarchy
2. Goal Setting (quarterly/annual)
3. 360-Degree Performance Reviews
4. Skill Assessment and Development Plans
5. Reports & Analytics (goal trends, skill gaps)

## Technical Stack:
- Frontend: Angular (modular)
- Backend: .NET 7+ Web API (modular or microservices)
- Database: SQL Server (EF Core)
- Auth: JWT with role-based access (Employee, Manager, HR Admin)

## Deliverables:
- Full architecture design (services, components, data models)
- Development roadmap (phased)
- Project folder structure (backend & frontend)
- Tech stack justification

Start by:
1. Analyzing the domain and functional boundaries
2. Suggesting a service breakdown
3. Providing a phased implementation plan
4. Proposing backend and frontend structure
5. Outlining core entities and database relationships

Make the output clean, modular, and developer-friendly.

## 1. üßë‚Äçüíº Employee Profile Service (Backend)

```
Generate a .NET Web API (C#, .NET 7+) for managing employee profiles.

## Features:
- Create, update, delete employee
- Store personal info, role/title, department
- Store reporting manager (self-referencing)
- List organizational hierarchy (recursive)

## Requirements:
- SQL Server database
- Use Entity Framework Core
- Use DTOs and AutoMapper
- Input validation with DataAnnotations
- JWT-based authorization (Admin, Manager roles)
- RESTful endpoints

Return:
- Models, DTOs
- Controllers
- DbContext and Migrations
- Role-based access
```

---

## 2. üéØ Goal Management Module (Backend + Frontend)

```
Design a goal-setting module for an HR app.

## Backend (C#, .NET Web API):
- Create quarterly/annual goals
- Associate goals with employees
- Support progress updates by employee & manager
- Track completion status and notes
- Fetch goals by quarter/year/employee
- SQL Server + EF Core

## Frontend (Angular):
- Component: Goal list, create/edit form
- Bind to API endpoints
- Use reactive forms
- Display progress as percentage bar

Generate:
- API structure, Angular components
- Models, DTOs, services
```

---

## 3. üìù Performance Review Module (360¬∞ Feedback)

```
Create a 360-degree feedback system for employee performance reviews.

## Features:
- Create performance cycles (quarterly, annual)
- Allow peer, self, and manager feedback
- Generate custom evaluation forms per cycle
- Support ratings, comments, and file attachments
- Submit and lock once completed
- Admin/Manager can view summaries

## Backend:
- .NET API with SQL Server
- Use EF Core for relational structure (employee ‚Üî feedbacks)

## Frontend:
- Angular components to submit feedback
- Dynamic form rendering (per review template)
- Show progress/status per review

Generate models, controllers, and Angular form logic.
```

---

## 4. üìä Skill Assessment & Development

```
Design a skill/competency tracking module.

## Features:
- Track employee skills and proficiency levels
- Manager can rate team members
- Suggest development plans (training, mentorship, etc.)
- View skill gaps by role/team

## Backend:
- .NET API (EF Core, SQL Server)
- Entities: Skill, EmployeeSkill, SkillRating, DevelopmentPlan
- Allow tagging skills to job roles

## Frontend:
- Angular table view with rating sliders
- Show recommended actions (training links, notes)
```

---

## 5. üìà Reports & Analytics Module

```
Generate a reporting service for the HR system.

## Reports to include:
- Goal achievement trends by employee/team/department
- Performance review status and scores
- Skill gap matrix per department
- Average rating per competency

## Backend:
- .NET API endpoints for reporting
- Use raw SQL or LINQ for optimized queries
- Paginated, filterable, grouped by date/team

## Frontend:
- Angular dashboard with charts (ng2-charts or ApexCharts)
- Filters for date range, department, etc.

Generate:
- Backend reporting endpoints
- Angular dashboard page with dynamic charts
```

---

## 6. üîê Authentication & Role-Based Access

```
Set up JWT-based authentication in .NET Web API.

## Requirements:
- Roles: Employee, Manager, HR Admin
- Login, Register, Refresh Token
- Use ASP.NET Identity or custom user table
- Secure endpoints with [Authorize(Roles = "...")]

Also generate Angular AuthService with login/register and route guards.
```

## üìå Step-by-Step Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: System Design & Architecture
- [ ] Use initial architecture prompt in Cursor
- [ ] Define services: Employee, Goals, Reviews, Skills, Reports
- [ ] Design database schema (ERD)
- [ ] Finalize backend folder structure and frontend modules

### Phase 2: Backend Service Development (using .NET)
- [ ] Implement Employee Service
- [ ] Implement Goal Management Service
- [ ] Implement Performance Review Service
- [ ] Implement Skill Assessment Service
- [ ] Implement Reporting Service
- [ ] Implement Authentication & Role Management

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (using Angular)
- [ ] Build Authentication Module with route guards
- [ ] Create Employee Profile UI (hierarchy view)
- [ ] Create Goal Setting UI with progress tracking
